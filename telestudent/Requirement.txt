I am looking for an experienced developer who can help build a scalable desktop app using electron as well as react, relay, graphql and material-ui. The basic objective of the app is to help students understand economics as well as some math and statistics. The requirements are as follows:
1. Authenticate the user (student) using a service such as FastSpring.
2. Read and display blocks of text from a database.
3. Read and display mathematics from a database (using Katex).
4. Load json files, if possible from the same database, and place their contents in a js object that can be accessed in electronâ€™s renderer processes. This information will be used to display graphs (e.g. on inflation) with the help of existing code (react and plotly).
5. Load metadata from a database that defines how to combine 2. to 4. in order to create pages relating to a specific subject (e.g. text block 1, text block 2, math block 1, json file 1, text block 3).

In addition, and as far as reasonably feasible, I would like the code base to be reusable for the creation of a web-app.

I am looking for a thoughtful, critical thinker with a good sense of creating a scalable code base.
